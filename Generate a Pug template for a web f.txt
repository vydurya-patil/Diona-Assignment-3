Generate a Pug template for a web form based on the attached PDF titled “Criminal Risk Assessment Request-e-request” and XLSForm “Criminal_Risk_Assessment_ODK_Form.xlsx”.
Use the XLSForm as the logical source (field types, required inputs, conditional visibility).

Instructions:
-Match field labels from the PDF
-Render each field in a clean Pug layout (input, select, textarea, etc.)
-Respect constraints (mandatory fields, formatting like Canadian date) Include conditionals for fields like “Unconsented”, which only shows when Name and Signature are blank
- For date of birth, split into Day/Month/Year inputs
- Use appropriate input types (e.g., `type="email"`, `type="tel"`)
- For multi-selects (e.g., IDs), use checkboxes

To generate a Pug template for a web form based on the provided instructions, I'll create a Pug file that includes the necessary fields, constraints, and conditional logic as described. Here's the complete Pug code for the form:
This Pug template includes all the necessary fields and logic as per your instructions. It uses appropriate input types, includes conditional visibility for certain sections, and splits the date of birth into day, month, and year inputs.
For the date of birth field, create a split input for Day, Month, and Year. Ensure that the format is compatible with Canadian dates (DD/MM/YYYY). Provide a clear label for each field for example 'Day', 'Month', 'Year' 

To create a split input for the date of birth field that is compatible with Canadian dates (DD/MM/YYYY), we need to ensure that each part of the date (day, month, year) is clearly labeled and structured. Here's how you can modify the Pug template to achieve this:
Explanation:
Labels: Each part of the date (Day, Month, Year) has a clear label to indicate what the input is for.
Select Inputs: The day, month, and year are each represented by a select input, allowing users to choose from a list of valid options.
Order: The order of the inputs is Day, Month, Year, which aligns with the Canadian date format (DD/MM/YYYY).
Required Fields: Each select input is marked as required to ensure that users must select a value for each part of the date.
This structure will help users input their date of birth in the correct format and ensure clarity in the form.
Include labels for all inputs, dropdowns, and checkboxes to improve the form's usability for all users

To improve the form's usability, we can ensure that each input, dropdown, and checkbox has a clear and descriptive label. This will help users understand what information is required for each field. Here's the updated Pug template with labels for all inputs, dropdowns, and checkboxes:
Key Changes:
Labels: Each input, dropdown, and checkbox now has a corresponding label to improve accessibility and usability.
Structure: The form is organized into sections with clear headings and labels, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the required information.
Ensure custom error messages are shown when fields are not filled correctly. Use pattern, required, or custom JavaScript to display error messages dynamically.

To ensure custom error messages are shown when fields are not filled correctly, we can use a combination of HTML attributes like pattern and required, along with custom JavaScript to handle validation and display error messages dynamically. Here's how you can implement this in your Pug template:
Updated Pug Template with Validation
26 hidden lines
8 hidden lines
32 hidden lines
Key Features:
Error Messages: Each field has a corresponding span element with a class of error-message to display custom error messages. These are initially hidden and shown only when validation fails.
JavaScript Validation: A validateForm function is added to check each field's validity when the form is submitted. If any field is invalid, the corresponding error message is displayed, and form submission is prevented.
HTML5 Validation: The required and pattern attributes are used for basic validation, and the validity property is checked in JavaScript for fields like email and phone.
Dynamic Error Display: Error messages are shown or hidden based on the validation results, providing immediate feedback to the user.
Use loops for repetitive fields like date of birth fields to reduce boilerplate code.

To reduce boilerplate code for repetitive fields like the date of birth fields, we can use loops in Pug to dynamically generate the options for the day, month, and year. Here's how you can refactor the Pug template to use loops for these fields:
Key Changes:
Day Options: A loop is used to generate the day options from 1 to 31.
Month Options: A loop iterates over an array of month names, using the index to generate the value in the format 01, 02, etc.
Year Options: A loop generates year options from the current year down to 1900.
This approach reduces redundancy and makes the code more maintainable.
Give day from 1 to 31 in the form of select drop down and year from 2000 to 2025 in the same pattern as mentioned above make it optimized

To optimize the Pug template for generating a dropdown for days from 1 to 31 and years from 2000 to 2025, we can use loops to dynamically create these options. Here's how you can update the Pug template:
Key Changes:
Day Options: A loop generates options for days from 1 to 31.
Year Options: A loop generates options for years from 2000 to 2025.
This approach ensures that the code is concise and easy to maintain, while still providing the necessary functionality for selecting days and years.
modify the code and dat of birth in a way that it should show calendar box to choose days months and year

To modify the date of birth input to show a calendar box for selecting the day, month, and year, you can use the input element with type="date". This will provide a date picker in most modern browsers, allowing users to select a date from a calendar interface. Here's how you can update the Pug template to use a date picker for the date of birth:
107 hidden lines
Key Changes:
Date Picker: The input element with type="date" is used for the date of birth, which provides a calendar interface for selecting the date.
Validation: The JavaScript validation is updated to check the value of the date input directly.
This approach simplifies the user experience by allowing them to select a date from a calendar, which is more intuitive and reduces the chance of input errors.
